;   Exercise 3.60
;   =============
;   
;   With power series represented as streams of coefficients as in exercise
;   [3.59], adding series is implemented by add-streams.  Complete the
;   definition of the following procedure for multiplying series:
;   
;   (define (mul-series s1 s2)
;     (cons-stream <??> (add-streams <??> <??>)))
;   
;   You can test your procedure by verifying that sin² x + cos² x = 1, using
;   the series from exercise [3.59].
